# STOR 390 Final Project: Evaluating Actuarial Risk Assessment Instruments and Their Ethical Implications
This repository contains five files for the STOR 390 Final Project submission.

• Novel Analysis (RMD and PDF): Contains the R code used to conduct the novel analysis of the COMPAS dataset. This file replicates Hart and Cooke's methodology using logistic regression and extends it with new approaches, such as interaction modeling and prediction interval analysis.

• Final Paper (RMD and PDF): Includes the complete final paper text, references, and supporting arguments.

• COMPAS Dataset (CSV): A publicly available dataset containing recidivism predictions, used for reproducing and analyzing bias and fairness in predictive algorithms. This dataset was used in the novel analysis portion of the project.

In their paper *Another Look at the (Im-)Precision of Individual Risk Estimates Made Using Actuarial Risk Assessment Instruments*, Hart and Cooke critique the reliability of ARAIs. This project builds on their work by applying their methods to the larger COMPAS dataset. Through the lens of utilitarian and deontological ethics, the paper argues that while ARAIs may offer efficiency at the group level, their use in individual decision-making raises profound ethical concerns.

This repository is a resource for exploring the limitations, ethical implications, and potential improvements for ARAIs in high-stakes domains.
